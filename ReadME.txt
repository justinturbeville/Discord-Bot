This at the moment only allows a user to send messages but there are way in which you can read messages a respond and all kinds of advanced stuff see that here https://www.devdungeon.com/content/make-discord-bot-python 

Use these commands you need to make sure you install updated and these packages are installed

sudo apt update & upgrade -y
sudo apt install python && sudo apt install python3
sudo apt install python-pip
sudo apt install python3-pip
python3 -m pip install -U discord.py
pip install discord-webhook

This is how you run a python program
make sure it has a .py extension

python [filename].py
or
python3 [filename].py

this is compatible with python 2, to make it work with python 3 you need to modify the input from raw_input to input
